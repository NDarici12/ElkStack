# ElkStack

Day 1

I set up the virtual network on my azure account, in the process of setting up the network I made sure to enable peering on the network. Once the Network was made I basically set up the VM with ELK using Docker. Once ELK was set up and made sure that only send traffic to the ELK Server.

Day 2

I installed the filebeat and begin configuring it via ansible; and set up the playbook.
